# It's Tailwind Devdude!

Whatsup people! I'm Tailwind Devdude, the coolest #webdev student at #TailwindCSS University where I shred with my best bud Alpine Johnson (we call him #Alpinejs cause its cooler). Man me and Alpine hit the slopes everyday, come home and rock a doobie, then code the dopest UIs you've ever seen until our eyes bleed and its time to sleep. 

Well I wouldn't really say we sleep at all cause there really never is time for sleep. Not when your busy chasing around all the babes on campus, skiing fat lines, and making sick websites with #tailwindcss and #alpinejs. We party hardy man, but we also work even hardier if you know what I mean. There is nothing more beautiful than the whir of that ol Mac Book computer going at 2 AM when you've got an backend #Nodejs report due for your midterm project. HAHA! Oh you know I'm kidding about that one my ladies and gentle-dudes. Let's just say my B.A.C. was higher than my GPA once or twice, y'know?

## Time for me to hit the rocker

Uh I'm not sure what that means? But I better get going cause I got a date with VS Code, so later allig8tors!
